# Data Product Charter

## Document control

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Data product ID/version | book-benefit-data / benefit.v1 demo and benefit.v2 source pilot |
| Product owner | bookchaowalit |
| Data owner/steward | bookchaowalit |
| Producer team | Domain repository |
| Status/review date | Local source pilot / 2026-09-07 |
| Evidence boundary | schema.json, demo.json and tests in this repository |

## Product contract

- Decision or user outcome: Discover entitlements and support by jurisdiction and eligibility.
- Consumers and use cases: Discovery applications; integration planned.
- Source systems and lake layers: Synthetic fixtures only today; permitted source → landing → Bronze planned.
- In scope/out of scope: Rule-based entitlement programs; marketing promotions belong to deal/freebie.
- Freshness, availability, and volume expectation: Target source review every 24h; open filter rejects checks older than 72h; no live SLA.
- Data classification, residency, retention, and access: Public synthetic fixtures; no user profile; raw retention must be set per future source before ingestion.
- Quality thresholds and incident route: All contract tests pass; live quality/replay gates pending; owner handles source failures.
- Cost/capacity guardrail: Offline only, zero provider calls; max 10,000 records per envelope.
- Versioning, deprecation, and migration policy: Draft v1; breaking changes version separately; no legacy migration or live consumer yet.
